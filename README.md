## Simple CRUD Project 🛠️

The project includes a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using interfaces and utility types to enhance code efficiency and robustness.

### Compiling the Project 🛠️

To compile the project, use the command:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all necessary dependencies and compile the TypeScript code.

### Running the Project 🏃‍♂️

To run each file, use the command:

```
